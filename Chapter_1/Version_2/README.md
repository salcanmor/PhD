# PhD chapter 1. Version 2. 

In this repository, you will find the very third attempt to get an automatic information collection system in tennis matches.

### Note: This project was made for running on Google Colab.

In this third iteration, PaddlePaddle (Parallel Distributed Deep Learning), which is the first independent R&D deep learning platform in China, was used.
To detect the players and the ball, the YoloX CNN was used.
To track the players, the ByteTrack tracking algorithm was used.
To track the ball, TrackNet (A Deep Learning Network for Tracking High-speed and Tiny Objects in Sports Applications) was used.
To detect the tennis court lines, the Hough Line Transform was used.

### Note: In the folder *videos*, you can find four videos. Two of them are input videos (raw), and the other two are the respective processed videos
