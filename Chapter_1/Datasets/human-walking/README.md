# Human Walking dataset

This dataset was originally recorded by the authors of the following paper:

O. Haggui, M. A. Tchalim, B. Magnier, A comparison of opencv algorithms for human tracking with a moving perspective camera, in: 2021 9th European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP), IEEE, 2021, pp. 1â€“6.

From that set of videos, those whose labels were missing or inaccurate were labeled. For the rest of the tagged videos, a script was created to pass their tags to the Pascal VOC XML format, thus, a new set of videos was obtained, with 100% of the videos accurately tagged and with all the tags according to the Pascal VOC XML standard. This dataset, along with all scripts and any other resources used in this work.


In each folder, you can find:

1) The video in MP4 format.
2) All the frames in JPG format
3) Their respective tags in PASCAL VOC XML format
4) The Matlab scripts used in this work and other files generated during this work.
